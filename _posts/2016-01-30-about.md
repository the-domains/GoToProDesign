## Ready and Creative

"Most of my work starts off as 
thumbnails - a series of marks in my sketchbook... As you will see I 
love my work, live my passion and strive for creativity everyday. I love
to get lost in illustration and draw all day and all night. I let 
everything go in drawing... It is what I have been doing my whole life 
as an expressive passion is both my hobbie and professional work. I love
what I do. What can I draw for you?" - Ry

##### **Forever lost in illustration I find myself. Raw energy! Exercising flow of mediums, methods and materials...**

Here in the online sketchbook
I love to showcase personal visual streams of refined conscious and 
subconscious creations- original \[raw\] sketches, portraits, mark-making,
expressions, animations, concepts, story-boarding, interior design, 
exterior design, experiments, characters and random doodles from when I 
was a kid to present day RyanWBaran. 

"Drawing from day one cause I love Drawing N' Drawing is fun!" - Ry
