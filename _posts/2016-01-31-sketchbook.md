## **ARCHIVED **\[SKETCHBOOK\]

Most of my work starts off as thumbnails - a series of marks in my sketchbook... As you will see I love my work, live my passion and strive for creativity everyday. I created "Lost in Illustration" a long time ago due to the fact I can sit and draw all day and night. I get lost in drawing and let everything go... What I have been doing my whole life as an expressive passion is both my hobby and professional work. I love what I do. What can I draw for you? - Ry
